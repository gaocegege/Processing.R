# Processing.R Design and Architecture

## Overview

[Processing](http://processing.org/) is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.

And there are many language modes in Processing, which includes [python mode](http://py.processing.org/), [native javascript mode](https://p5js.org/) and [android mode](http://android.processing.org/). These modes allows users with specific language to get started with Processing easily.

Processing.R is a [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) mode for Processing, which has a similiar architecture to [python mode](http://py.processing.org/). R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. With Processing.R, users could write Processing sketches using R.
