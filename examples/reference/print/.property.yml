	The <b>print()</b> function writes to the console area, the black rectangle at the bottom of the Processing environment. This function is often helpful for looking at the data a program is producing.<br/>
<br />
Using <b>print()</b> on an object will output a string representation of that object, as determined by its internal <b>__str__</b> and <b>__repr__</b> methods (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/2626364\">more information here</a>).<br/><br/>
In R Mode, <b>print()</b> and <b>println()</b> are functionally identical.
